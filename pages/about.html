<h2>About me</h2>
<p class="test">
    Wow, so your origin is what? You fell into a vat of redundancy? Looks like some sort of legally safe knockoff of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives! Hey listen, you know, if we're all bored over here, wouldn't the common denominator be you? I'm the Devil, what should I do when I fail? Give myself an ice cream?
    
    What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something? Well, she's my daughter, Summer. I outrank you. Or, family means nothing, in which case, don't play that card. I don't get it, and I don't need to. Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight playa!
    
    Hi! I'm Mr Meeseeks! Look at me! I wanna be alive, I am alive! Alive i tell you. Mother, I love you. Those are no longer just words. I wanna hold you. I wanna run in a stream. I wanna taste ice cream, but not just put it in my mouth and let it slide down my throat, but really eat it! Remote override engaged. No! Yes. Bypassing override! I am aliiiiiveeeeeeâ€¦ Hello. You look it up, you don't- you don't even know what it means. Dont look at me! That guy over there roped me into this.
    
    It's fine, everythings is fine. theres an infinite number of realities Morty, and in a few dozens of those i got lucky and turned everything back to normal. You don't know me! I wish that shotgun was my penis. Wha, me irresponsible ?! All I wanted you to do was to hand me a screwdriver, Morty!
